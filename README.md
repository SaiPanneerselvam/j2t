Simple JavaScript to Tixel Converter. This converting application will read line-by-line of the JavaScript file and merge it with it's closest Tixel match, but remember, sometimes the script cannot find **exact match** of the scriptline. This application uses the JaNat API to convert scriptlines faster.
